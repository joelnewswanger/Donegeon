# Donegeon

Donegeon is a funny game I wrote when I was first learning Python years ago.
It was a text based dungeon crawl, based around the random selection of adjectives.

I rewrote the code recently, to practice proper coding form such as OOP.
I ended up having a lot of fun with it again, and adding some new functionality.

You can find the game hosted on my [personal portfolio](https://joelnewswanger.github.io/) if you want to play.
Just know that it is a completely random assortment of adjectives. Please don't be offended if it calls you colorful names.
